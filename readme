Aurum: Criminal Intelligence in Wildlife Trafficking
Aurum is a modular and interactive platform for criminal intelligence in wildlife trafficking, developed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) ‚Äì Brazil.

It empowers analysts, researchers, and enforcement professionals with data-driven insights through a user-friendly web interface built on Streamlit.

Key Features
Case Data Upload
Upload your own wildlife trafficking data (.xlsx) to start analyzing immediately. A ready-to-use template is provided.

Trend Analysis
Explore trends in seizure patterns over time, using Segmented Regression (TCS) and CUSUM to detect significant changes.

Species Co-occurrence
Identify statistically significant co-trafficking relationships between species using Chi-square tests.

Anomaly Detection
Detect atypical or high-impact cases through multiple methods:
Isolation Forest
Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
DBSCAN Clustering
Z-Score
Mahalanobis Distance

Criminal Network Analysis
Visualize networks connecting trafficking cases based on shared attributes such as species and offender countries.

Interactive Dashboards
Build and customize visualizations dynamically: bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, line graphs, and world maps.

Public Alert Board
View, submit, and update public alerts on wildlife trafficking risks, visible to all users.

Multi-user System
Includes login, account requests, admin approval, user access control, and case submission/editing functionalities.

Export Options
Easily download cleaned datasets (.xlsx) and full analysis reports (.html).

Built-in Feedback System
Users can submit suggestions and comments directly through the platform.

How It Works
Launch the app (via Streamlit).
Upload your data (.xlsx) or log in to access multi-user tools.
Select species or fields to analyze.
Choose modules:
Trend analysis
Species co-occurrence
Anomaly detection
Network analysis
Export results in .xlsx or .html formats.
Submit cases and alerts if you are a registered user.
